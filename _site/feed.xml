This website was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is generated as a static site using Jekyll (Ruby). Jekyll allows you to build the website as components without having to manually join all the pieces together. This reduces development time and the chance of error by allowing you to only have to make changes in one location. The final generated site can then be hosted on Github Pages or Cloudflare Pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary type="html">This website is a place on the internet to store my projects and other personal information.
